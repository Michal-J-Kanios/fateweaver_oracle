        Start by entering Exploration mode and rolling up the foundations of your "scene".
        Next, once you've filled in the blanks with your imagination or just written the scene somewhere,
        depending on how your Exploration went, go either into Combat mode or Roleplay mode!
        But wait, you haven't designed locations for your playthrough? No worries! Exploration mode also features
        an integrated Settlement Designer that allows you to create entire towns on the fly. Be sure to take notes though!
        In case something unexpected wrecks your party, roll on the "Consequences" table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combat mode allows you to randomly decide how your enemies are going to act. What are they fighting for?
        What's the role of a given enemy? What tactics do they use? When will the fight end?
        In addition to all of the above, Combat mode also provides you with an opportunity to spice up your encounters
        by randomly choosing an alternate initiative-tracking method, so that no round will ever be the same!
        In case you are defeated - as mentioned earlier, roll on the "Consequences" table in Explorer mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Roleplay mode, you'll access some of the most imporant parts of the oracle, such as:
        decision-making (Yes/No questions), description/writing prompts for specific senses (e.g. imagine the smell of X, or the sound of Y), NPC attitudes, status quo of a given scene,
        and extra details like merchant stinginess, costs of clerical services, etc.
        But wait, you couldn't come up with any NPCs to interact with? No biggie! Roleplay mode also features
        an integrated NPC Designer that allows you to create memorable characters on the fly. Be sure to take notes though!
