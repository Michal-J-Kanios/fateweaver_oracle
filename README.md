# FATE WEAVER üé≤
## Solo Play Oracle for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Have you ever wanted to play D&D solo for whatever reason?
Have you ever TRIED to do so? If your answer is yes, chances are you've probably noticed how hard it is to act both as a DM and as a player.
You will inevitably gravitate towards subjective decision-making based on feelings, and not logic or randomness, essentially robbing your campaign of any sense of accomplishment, agency, danger, etc. With **Fate Weaver**, the oracle alleviates that problem. :)

## Status:
- Spent precious time trying to learn figma, turns out it it's not what I needed right now.
- Will hopefully get back to the project a day or two later once I settle on the design.
