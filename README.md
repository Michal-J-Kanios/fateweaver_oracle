### Have you ever wanted to play D&D solo for whatever reason?
- Friends don't want to play D&D?
- Your previous party gave you a hard time?
- Never had friends to begin with?
- Want to optimize character builds or engage in creative writing?
Whatever the reason, **Fate Weaver** has got you covered!
### Have you ever TRIED to play solo?
  If your answer is yes, chances are you've probably noticed how hard it is to act both as the DM and as a player.
You will inevitably gravitate towards subjective decision-making based on your feelings, essentially robbing your campaign of any sense of accomplishment, agency, danger, etc.
With **Fate Weaver**, the oracle alleviates such problems by:
- (Exploration) Generating a foundation to build scenes upon (setting, theme, plot point, quest, current scene, and the general "vibe" of things)
- (Combat) Determining initiatve, tactics, and generally taking command of enemies and monsters alike (if you ever get stuck on who should they target or how they should fight)
- (Decision-making Roleplay) Presenting unbiased answers to "Yes or No" questions or other probability disputes (likely/unlikely/very likely/etc.)
- (Actual Roleplay) Providing you with sensory descriptions and prompts to write descriptions around, as well as rolling up a status quo of the current scene's roleplay and determining NPC attitudes, such as friendly, neutral or hostile (also adds details for immersion, such as the stinginess of merchants, prices of cleric services, etc)
  
## Why Fate Weaver?
  As a fledgling solo ttrpg player, you've probably heard of Mythic, DM Yourself, and other DM-emulating oracles. They're great, don't get me wrong, but flipping through the pages to get what you need can get tiresome. What if we made an oracle that requires no physical dice, doesn't take up your desk space, and is more streamlined towards D&D 5E - *world's greatest roleplaying game?* Enter: Fate Weaver.

## Planned Features
- Exploration Mode
- Roleplay Mode
- Combat Mode
- Integrated Dice Roller
- Integrated NPC Generator

## Status Report:
### Update 1
- Spent precious time trying to learn figma, turns out it's pretty cool, but ultimately a paid service.
- As of right now (Day 1 of the project), I'm leaving things as they are (with this readme file sadly being my only contribution)
- Don't worry though, I'm only getting started!
