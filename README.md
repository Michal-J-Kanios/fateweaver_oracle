## Your adventure went off the rails and you can't find...
- Any random encounter tables?
- An NPC generator?
- A settlement designer?
## Are you confused on...
- What to do next?
- When to make something happen?
- What should happen during exploration?
### Have you ever wanted to play D&D solo, because...
- Your friends don't want to play D&D?
- You never had friends to begin with?
- You want to try out character builds or engage in creative writing?
# Whatever the reason, Fate Weaver has got you covered!
With multiple compact roll tables available at the push of a button, you too can enhance your D&D sessions through the power of randomisation!
### Have you ever TRIED to play solo?
  If your answer is yes, chances are you've probably noticed how hard it is to act both as the DM and as a player.
You will inevitably gravitate towards subjective decision-making based on your feelings, essentially robbing your campaign of any sense of accomplishment, agency, danger, etc.
With **Fate Weaver**, the oracle alleviates such problems by:
- (Exploration) Generating a foundation to build scenes upon (setting, theme, plot point, quest, current scene, and the general "vibe" of things)
- (Combat) Determining initiatve, tactics, and generally taking command of enemies and monsters alike (if you ever get stuck on who should they target or how they should fight)
- (Decision-making Roleplay) Presenting unbiased answers to "Yes or No" questions or other probability disputes (likely/unlikely/very likely/etc.)
- (Actual Roleplay) Providing you with sensory descriptions and prompts to write descriptions around, as well as rolling up a status quo of the current scene's roleplay and determining NPC attitudes, such as friendly, neutral or hostile (also adds details for immersion, such as the stinginess of merchants, prices of cleric services, etc)
  
## Why Fate Weaver?
  As a fledgling solo ttrpg player, you've probably heard of Mythic, DM Yourself, and other DM-emulating oracles, as well as the tons of roll tables they provide. They're great, don't get me wrong, but flipping through the pages to get what you need can get tiresome. What if we made an oracle that requires no physical dice, doesn't take up your desk space, and is more streamlined towards D&D 5E - *the world's greatest roleplaying game?* Enter: Fate Weaver. Hundreds of roll tables at the push of a button, all for your rolling pleasure.
